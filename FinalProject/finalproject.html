        <h2>THINGS I LOVE</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          I am a very busy person between working and going to school but in my free time I enjoy being outside, traveling, shopping and spending time with friends and family. My favorite activities to do outside are hiking, running, walking and playing with the kids I work with playing whatever their small creative minds can come up with. Traveling is not something I have done a ton of yet but hope to containue to do as I got on my first plane 4 years ago at 18 and have been traveling to new places a couple times a year since. I have only made it so far to Mexico, Nashville, and North Carolina (although I am there alot visiting my boyfriend). Within the next two years my goal is to go to France as well as California. Shopping is a hobby I picked up working retail for so many years (and I am good at it). I can find the best deals on the best stuff everywhere I go and nothing makes me happier than a trip to Sephora or Ulta. Although I love all these things, I mainly focus alot of spending time with friends and faimly during free time.

        <h2>PEOPLE I LOVE</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          I have many people in my life that means alot to me. Firstly, I am the middle child of 3 girls. My older sister Holly is 25, married and has two boys of her own. My nephews are Nolan who is 4, and Reid who is 1. Holly is a great Mom and wise older sister I can always look to for advice. My younger sister is 18 and the wild child of the family. She is extremely unpredictable, outspoken and amazingly creative. She is one of my best friends and I admire her personality although it is nothing like my own. My roomate Eileen I have known over 10 years and she has been also like a sister to me for that time, my other roomate is Renee. I have known her for about a year now and am so greatful to have had her come into my life as she balances out me and Eileen. Eileen and I can be two opposite ends of the spectrum so Renee is now important part of our friendship. My boyfriend Noah I have known also for about 10 years although we just started dating about 6 months ago. He is a Marine stationed in North Carolina.
