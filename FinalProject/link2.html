        <h2>SCHOOL</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br> I graduated from Manchester Central High School in 2015. Following this I began attending Uniersity of New Hampshire, Durham where I went for a semester until I decided that it was not for me and moved back home and transferred to UNHM. At this time I also accepted a full time role at American Eagle Outfitters but more of that below. I have been part time at school since spring of 2016 and will be returning to full time next semester, Spring 2019. After taking business courses I declared my major as business with the accounting option after becoming fond of the black-and-white, right-wrong feeling that accounting is. My hopeful graduation date is in Spring of 2020. </p></center>

        <h2>WORK</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          After leaving UNH Durham in the fall of 2015 I took a role managing at American Eagle Outfitters in Manchester where I had worked prior to leaving for school for about 2 years. I fell in love with this role and continued to work my way up in management for about 4 years until I became the associate store manager. I was passionate about this job because of the people role it entailed, working with people and managing my team were my favorite parts about getting up and going into work everyday. I had roles that included hiring, goal-specific task teams, merchandising, and operational jobs. This as fun as it was, completed drained me and found myself with an empty tank most of the time with no eergy to focus on my school work. I ultimately left AEO in September 2018 and now work full time as a nanny to 4 children.

        <h2>NANNY LIFE</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          Nannying has been the best decision I have ever made. As much as I loved my job at AE the stress did wear at me and is what left me feeling drained so often. Although nannying is tiring, there is so much more of a rewarding feeling and pure happiness I get to feel working with wonderful little minds everyday. The oldest is a boy named Tuck he is 5 and is etremely smart, he is constantly trying to figure out how things work. He also loves to use his imagination and think up fun games and scenarios for himself and his younger siblings to play out. Next is Aurelia, she is the only girl of the family and is 4 years old. Her nickname is Ray and she is the little mother of her siblings. Even at 4 Ray is always trying to help accomplish everyday tasks like getting her big brother ready for school, or making a snack for her little brother, or even watching the baby while he plays. She is so sweet and is really the compliment to the third child. Jaxon is the third kids in the family and he is 2 but has enough sass and wit for all 4 siblings combined. Jaxon is always doing his best to keep up with his older siblings regardless that he is younger, he also is known for terrorizing the house but in the blink of an eye sweetening up and changing his voive to ask for a treat. Lastly, Bodhi is the baby and is only 9 months old, his personality is starting to shine though as well as his teeth which makes him irritable and doesnt want to sleep. I never thought I would love kids so much that I am not related to but they're angels and I am so lucky to feel like an extenstion to the family.
