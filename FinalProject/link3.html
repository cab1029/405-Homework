        <h2>501</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          I live with my roomates at a house numbered 501 and since we moved in we never called our apartment home, but instead called it "501". I moved in with my roomates at 501 in Fall of 2018 when their other roomate Shawna moved out because her and her boyfriend got their own place after they got pregnant, by surprise, lol. Anyway my roomates both are in school as well at mcc and nhti studying childhood education and business. Eileen and Renee have been here an additonal year as they lived here with Shawna previously. Living here we have a pretty open home, we have many friends come through when they need a place to hang or get out. Currently we have an additional roomate named Bri, who has been Renee's friend since childhood. Bri is going to school for nursing and her favorite color is purple. In our spare time we like to bake cookies, and watch holiday movies. The only issue we have living at 501 are the parking situation as we live in a two family home as an apartment and our downstairs neighbors also have three people living there, so 6 cars and a narrow driveway can be tough.

        <h2>6-17</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          Before I lived at 501 I lived with another roommate that I use to work with at AEO. Her name is Jocelyn, she moved to Boston when we both moved out to pursue a job at Wayfair. Jocelyn went to school studying fashion merchandising at Southern New Hampshire University. We met while working at AE when we were 16 and 17 and then moved in togther at 20 and 21. Living together in our first apartment was so fun as I will always think of her as the perfect roomate (no shade toward my current roommates who are some of my closest friends). Jocelyn kept to her self, never helped herself to my things but was always there when I wanted a friend or to borrow a sweater. I still see Jocelyn often, visiting back and forth.

        <h2>DREAM HOME</h2>
        <p><center>
          <br>
          I dont have a third place I have lived yet so I am going to take this space to talk about what my dream home would be like. As an avid HGTV-er I am obviously a giant Joanna Gaines fan it is safe to say i love the french country styled homes. This include alot of white washed brick, natural wood finishes, and vintage touches. As well as this style I hope my home would have a white-ish kitchen. With marble counter tops as well as grey stained, natural wood cabinets or open shevling. My house would have a porch as well as a lot of land. Also on my must have list I hope I would have a clawfoot tub, finished basement, and a sun room on the back of the house, with a pool. This is a like a said a dream home and if I ever some home achieve this I'll be sure to update this page to show you.
